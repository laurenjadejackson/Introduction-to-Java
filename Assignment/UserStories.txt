AS A User

I WANT a program that allows a User to either input a sentence using keyboard input, or a file input, or a demo 

SO THAT the program will count the Letter Frequencies of the sentence. 



EPIC on user interface

GIVEN a user launches the program
WHEN user launches program
***THEN user should be presented with "Welcome to my Java Assignment"
***AND it should print out "Pick an option, Keyboard, Demo, FileInput"


GIVEN user has launched the program and been presented to chose an option
WHEN the user picks Keyboard 
***THEN the user will be prompted to enter a sentence 

GIVEN the user has chosen a sentence
WHEN the user enters a sentence and clicks enter
THEN it should print out "Pick an option, bar chart or table"



GIVEN the user has launched the program and been presented to chose an option
WHEN the user picks Demo
THEN the user will be presented with a demo sentence

GIVEN the user has the demo sentence 
WHEN the user clicks enter
THEN it should print out "Pick an option, bar chart or table"



GIVEN the user has launches the program and been presented to chose an option
WHEN the user picks FileInput
THEN the user will be prompted to enter a file

GIVEN the user has chosen a file
WHEN the users enters the file name and clicks enter
THEN it should print out "Pick an option, bar chart or table"



GIVEN the user has clicked enter and chose an option
WHEN the user picks Bar chart
THEN the user will be presented with a barchart
AND the bar chart will have characters up the side
AND numbers across the bottom

GIVEN the user has clicked enter and chose an option
WHEN the user picks table
THEN it should print out a table
AND the table has character column, frequency column, relative frequency column



EPIC on Counting Characters 

GIVEN that a User has entered a sentence in some format 
WHEN the String is passed in
THEN the String should be split into individual Characters
AND loop through all the characters to count how many times each one occurs in the split String
AND the character Count will be printed in the console in an array format



EPIC on FileInput

GIVEN that a user wants to read text from a file 
WHEN they enter a file name 
THEN it will read all the text in the file 



EPIC on creating a BarChart

GIVEN the Character Count prints out the array of characters
WHEN I chose to see a BarChart
THEN all the characters stated in the character count should be in a bar chart layout

GIVEN the bar chart layout is set up
WHEN the characters in the inputted sentence are counted 
THEN they should be represented by squares in the bar chart
AND the bar chart should be printed in the console 



EPIC on Creating the Table 

GIVEN a string is read in
WHEN the user selects the table output option
THEN table headings will print out 
AND all the characters will be printed under the Characters heading 
AND the counted Frequencies are printed under the Frequency Heading 
AND the Relative Frequency is printed under the Relative Frequency heading 

GIVEN the Characters, Frequencies and Relative Frequencies are printed 
WHEN they are printed to the console
THEN they should be formatted to the middle of the column under the correct headings

GIVEN the correct information is stored under the correct heading
WHEN the table is printed to the console
THEN a Column Resize method should be used to keep the column the correct width
